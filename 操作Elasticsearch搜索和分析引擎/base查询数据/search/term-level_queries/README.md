## Term-level queries

You can use term-level queries to find documents based on precise values in structured data. Examples of structured data
include date ranges, IP addresses, prices, or product IDs.

Unlike full-text queries, term-level queries do not analyze search terms. Instead, term-level queries match the exact
terms stored in a field.
